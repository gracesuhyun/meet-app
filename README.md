## Meet App

The objective of this project is to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. Use the following link to view a demo video of this project:

*The Meet app is using the Google Calendar API for educational purposes only. The calendar accessed isn’t the user’s but a calendar provided by CareerFoundry as part of their Full-Stack Immersion course. No user information is saved or used within the application, and personal calendars aren’t accessed.*


## Key Features

- Filter events by city.
- Show/hide event details.
- Specify number of events.
- Use the app when offline.
- Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
- View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city
